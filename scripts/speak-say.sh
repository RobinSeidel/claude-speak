# Speaks stdin text via the detected TTS backend (macOS `say`, or espeak-ng/
# espeak on Linux — see tts-backend.sh), applying the persisted rate (words
# per minute) from ~/.claude/claude-speak/rate and voice from
# ~/.claude/claude-speak/voice if set — see /speak-rate and /speak-voice.
# Shared by speak-format.sh (mechanical path) and /speak's llm mode, so both
# stay consistent across backends.
#
# The backend is launched fully detached (own process group via `set -m`,
# plus disown) rather than awaited inline. A hook's "async" flag keeps it
# from blocking the turn, but the process can still be reaped once the
# turn/session ends — which cuts speech off mid-sentence on any response
# long enough to still be talking when the next message is sent. Detaching
# it lets it keep playing independently of this script's own lifetime.
